  <h3>The Emperor Chair:</h3>
  <p>Emperor chairs have lots of unique things about them. They have the chairs connected to the monitors which make them powerful. Also, they come in red, blue green and purple. You can move the chair forward or backward and you can move away from the screen or closer. There is even a cup holder for a drink! It has a cheaper price than other people sell it for.</p>
  <h2>The Classic chair</h2>
  <p>The Classic chairs aren't ass cool as the emperor chair, but their still awesome. For the classic chairs you can get them in any color so like red, blue, orange, purple, green, black, white, and yellow.  They are very comfortable like the emperor chair, but don't have the same elements.</p>
